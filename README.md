<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

The **AR Stack Builder Game** is a Computer Graphics Mini-Project designed to explore the capabilities of Augmented Reality (AR) in mobile gaming. By leveraging **Google's ARCore** for plane detection and tracking, and **Unity** for 3D rendering and physics, this game allows players to stack 3D blocks in their real-world environment.

The objective is simple yet challenging: build the highest stack possible without letting it topple over, testing both the player's precision and the stability of the virtual structure in the physical world.
